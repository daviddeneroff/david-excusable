Hello and welcome to excusable. This is the best app to track why members of your cohort are late and as a group you can vote and comment on whether their excuse is valid or not.

Login page: login or sign up.

Main page: scroll through all the excuses of your cohort. allows you to delete all of your posts from this page. can click on individual excuses.

Individual excuses: main area of the app. Ajax calls for votes and comments, but be careful. Can't type certain words or the comment will be stopped (only if the word "booger" is in that comment)

Profile: see your posts and whatnot

Make excuse: form to fill out your excuse

Logout: self explanatory with a pop up.

That's it. Hope you enjoy the app
